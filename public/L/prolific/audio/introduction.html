    <p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in our study.</p> 
    <p>You will be required to listen to two homilies and answer questions pertaining to each homily.
    Please be sure you are in a quiet space with the volume at a comfortable listening level. You will be required to complete this review in one sitting. </p>
    <p>Please be sure you have 35-40 minutes to complete this review in its entirety. Please listen to the entire homily. You will not be allowed to fast forward through the homily, but you can rewind in order to review, as needed. 
      Once you have completely viewed the first homily, please answer the questions for that homily before moving on to the second homily.</p>
    <p>There will be two additional questionnaires after you complete the homilies and their associated questionnaires.</p>
    <p><b>Please remember to complete the two additional questionnaires after completing the homilies and their associated questionnaires. You will not receive compensation if you do not complete these questionnaires.</b></p>
    <p>Thank you for your participation. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at
      matelskiboulware@uchicago.edu. </p>
