<!-- Things to check in this file: User behavior statistics appear correct, user gets served a homily properly, 
      the homily that they are served is of the right type, the user is redirected to another homily if they 
      are not done with homilies and redirected to the first of the questionnaires if they are done, 
      the user can reload the homily by refreshing the page, the user can rewind the homily but cannot
      fast forward through it (fast forward past the furthest point they have already achieved)-->
