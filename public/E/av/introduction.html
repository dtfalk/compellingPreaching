    <p>Welcome to the homily review. Your thorough review of the homilies will help us understand the effectivenesss of each homily and the mechanisms for that effectiveness.</p>
    <p><b>Follow the instructions below carefully:</b></p>
    <p>You will listen to four homilies from different preachers.
      After each homily you will be asked a series of questions about the homily.
    Please pay attention during each homily and answer all of the questions.
    After listening to the homilies there will be two additional questionnaires.</p>
    <p>If you decide to take a break, then please break after completing the homily and its matched questions, 
      not in the middle of a homily or before you have completed the questions for that homily. If you take 
      a break before a homily and its questions are completed, then you will need to rewatch that homily. 
      To resume your review after a break you only need to reenter your user ID number.</p>
    <p><b>Please remember to complete the two additional questionnaires after completing the homilies and their associated questionnaires. You will not receive compensation if you do not complete these questionnaires.</b></p>
    <p>Thank you for your participation. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at
      matelskiboulware@uchicago.edu. </p>
