            <h1>University of Chicago Online Consent Form for Research Participation </h1>
            <h2><b>Study Number: </b> IRB24-0068</h2>
            <h2><b>Study Title: </b> Understanding Preaching</h2>
            <h2><b>Researcher(s): </b> Howard Nusbaum</h2>
            <h2><b>Sponsor: </b> Catholic Theological Union</h2><br>

            <h2><b>Description </b> </h2>
            <p> We are researchers at the University of Chicago working with the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago 
              carrying out a study to understand preaching as communication. There is a collection of homilies taken from 
              different sources and we would appreciate it greatly if you would review the recordings of these homilies and 
              rate them using a questionnaire. We will also ask for your demographic information and information about your
              preaching experiences and expertise in instruction. </p>
            <p> You have been asked to review these homilies as an expert of homiletics. Your review is completely
              voluntary and we would greatly appreciate your participation. </p>
            <p> Reviews should take less than 30 minutes per homily. There is a total of four homilies.
                We would appreciate it if you can complete the reviews within two weeks.
                The rate at which you go through the content is under your control. You may log in and out of the survey and take as many breaks as needed.</p>

            <h2><b>Incentives </b></h2>
            <p> We appreciate your expertise and offer compensation of one hundred dollars provided by our research grant that is joint with Catholic Theological Union for
              your review of the complete set of homilies. In addition, we will provide you with any reports arising from this research based on the data of all the expert homiletic reviewers.</p>

            <h2><b>Risks and Benefits </b> </h2>
            <p> Your participation in this study does not involve any risk to you beyond that of everyday life.
              Risks for this task are minimal and include boredom, minor fatigue, and the possibility of a breach of confidentiality.
              Taking part in this research study may not benefit you personally beyond learning about psychological research, 
              but we may learn new things that could help others and contribute to the field of psychology.</p>

            <h2><b>Confidentiality </b> </h2>
            <p>Any identifiable data or information collected by this study will never be shared outside the research team. De-identified 
              information from this study may be used for future research studies or shared with other researchers for future research 
              without your additional informed consent. We may also upload your data (in both aggregate and individual form) to public data repositories. 
              Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or presented, 
              your individual name will not be used. If you decide to withdraw from this study, any data already collected will be destroyed.</p>
            
            <h2><b>Contacts and Questions </b></h2>
            <p>If you have questions or concerns about the study, you can contact Jean Matelski Boulware at (312) 860-9260 or at matelskiboulware@uchicago.edu. </p>
            <p>If you have any questions about your rights as a participant in this research, feel you have been harmed, 
              or wish to discuss other study-related concerns with someone who is not part of the research team, 
              you can contact the University of Chicago Social & Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB) Office by phone at (773) 702-2915, 
              or by email at sbs-irb@uchicago.edu. </p>
            
            <h2><b>Consent </b></h2>
            <p>Participation is voluntary. Refusal to participate or withdrawing from the research will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you might otherwise be entitled.</p>
            <p>By selecting “I agree” below, you confirm that you have read the consent form, are at least 18 years old, and agree to participate in the research. Please print or save a copy of this page for your records.</p>  
            <p>By selecting “I do NOT agree” you will be taken to a screen that exits you from the survey.</p>
